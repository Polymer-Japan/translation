title: Tools overview
---

The Polymer Project offers a range of tools to help developers write web components:

* The [Polymer CLI](polymer-cli) is our recommended "swiss army knife" for Polymer tooling. It supports a collection of commands for common scenarios like serving, testing, and initializing new projects from templates.

* The [polymer.json specification](polymer-json) describes how to configure your Polymer project and its builds. 

* [Web Component Tester](tests) is an end-to-end testing environment built by the Polymer team.  

* The [Web services](services) page lists helpful services to speed up the development process.

For information on the build and deployment processes for Polymer applications, see the [Polymer App Toolbox section](/{{{polymer_version_dir}}}/toolbox/).
